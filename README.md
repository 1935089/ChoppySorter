# ChoppySorter

This Python script organizes files in a specified download directory based on their file extensions.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this program you need to download Python if not already done.

## Running the program

You can run this on your editor or by running python ChoppySorter.py in your command prompt (make sure to be in the same folder or to specify a path).
